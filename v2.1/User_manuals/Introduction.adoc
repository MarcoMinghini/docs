In the *Esxecutable Test Suites* section all available (respectively installed) Executable Test
Suites are listed. Within this section, an Executable Test Suite can be
selected and run against a Test Object.

NOTE: A Test Object can consists of one or multiple artifacts and can,
for example, manifest multiple GML files or an entire system like a
Web Feature Service.

The *Status* section shows all tests that are currently executed on the
system and enables to open a monitor view for single test runs.

The *Test reports* section list the test results of completed test runs.

The *Help* link refers to a help page. Unless otherwise set by the administrator,
it refers to this page.

Also there is a fifth view and it's the *Test Classes*, this one doesn't appear in the menu and it is the default one, the landing view.
