* link:https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/download.php[Jetty 9 installed]

=== Install ETF web application on Windows

Download these resources provided in the ETF webpage:

* link:https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/releases/tag/2.1.0-rc.1[etf-webapp.war] 
* link:https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-suitd/releases/tag/2.1.0-rc.1[etf-suitd-legacy-2.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar]
* link:https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-tetd/releases/tag/1.1.0-rc.1[etf-tetd-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar]
* link:https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-bsxtd/releases/tag/3.0.0-rc.1[etf-bsxtd-legacy-2.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar]

Inside the ETF-webapp create a testdrivers folder, in which the  other three resources (etf-suitd-legacy-2.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar, etf-tetd-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar, etf-bsxtd-legacy-2.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) have to be added. 

Copy the etf-webapp.war file to **JETTY_HOME/webapps** or if you have created a JETTY_BASE, then copy the etf-webapp.war file to **JETTY_BASE/webapps**.

NOTE: The default JETTY_HOME is located at **/usr/share/jetty9**. In case you downloaded it form a browser, JETTY_HOME would be where are the folders containing jetty9.

Initiate Jetty 9 using **java -jar start.jar** in JETTY_HOME or JETTY_BASE, in case you have one.

NOTE: To stop the process use *CTRL+C*.

Download <<ets-installation>> and extract archives into the **~/.etf/projects** directory. The web application will automatically load the Executable Test Suites after a few seconds.

The web application can be accessed via link:http://localhost:8080/etf-webapp[http://localhost:8080/etf-webapp].

If ETF is accessed not only from one local machine, the **etf.webapp.base.url** property must be changed in the <<etf-configuration-dir>> to your server address (e.g. http://etf-server:8080/etf-webapp).

Check the <<etf-log-file>> file for errors.
